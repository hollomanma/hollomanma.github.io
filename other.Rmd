Here is a project I did in my Sports Analytics class (MAT 4010). It compares Michael Jordan to Lebron James. My results were that Michael Jordan is better than Lebron James.

Here is an assignment I did for my Numerical Methods class (MAT 4310). This code looks at how to implement Guassian elimination to help solve difficult systems of linear equations using matrices and arrays in python. Shown below is the python code (you may copy and paste this code into a python environment) and then the results.

Here is a project I did for my Sports Analytics class (MAT 4010). It compares different players' rushing statistics to the NFL combine data in order to predict players' rushing performance. These comparisons were made through decision trees.

Here is my final project for my Numerical Methods class (MAT 4310). This project explains and derives Laguerre polynomials. It also explains how to use them when wanting to approximate integrals numerically through Gaussian quadrature.

Here is a project I did in my Sports Analytics class (MAT 4010). It looks at cluster plots to determine which teams have the best and most consistent winning streaks.

Here is a project I did for my math biology class (MAT 3350). This project focuses on how deer population is affected by different predator versus prey relationships.

Here is a project I did in my Sports Analytics class (MAT 4010). The task what to attempt to make a better college ranking system than the polls to predict bowl game winners. That meant our ranking system had to have above a 61% accuracy. We achieved a 65.85% accuracy for our ranking system.

Here is a project I did in my Sports Analytics class (MAT 4010). It looks at how important hitting is to winning while comparing different stats of five teams to others using scatter and time series plots.

Here is a cool 3D volcano plot that I made :)
```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(plotly)
plot_ly(z = ~volcano) %>% add_surface()
```


Here is a video I made with two other group members on the Schwarzschild Metric for my Differential Geometry class (MAT 4140).
