# Past Projects


Here is a project I did In my Sports Analytics class (MAT 4010). It compares Michael Jordan to Lebron James. My results were that Michael Jordan is better than Lebron James.

Here is an assignment I did for my Numerical Methods class (MAT 4310). This code looks at how to implement Guassian elimination to help solve difficult systems of linear equations using matrices and arrays in python. Shown below is the python code (you may copy and paste this code into a python environment) and then the results.

Here is a project I did for my Sports Analytics class (MAT 4010). It compares different players rushing statistics to the NFL combine data to predict players' rushing performance. These comparisons were made through decision trees.

Here is my final project for my Numerical Methods class (MAT 4310). This project explains and derives Laguerre polynomials. It also explains how to use them when wanting to approximate integrals numerically through Gaussian quadrature.

Here is a cool 3D volcano plot that I made :)
```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(plotly)
plot_ly(z = ~volcano) %>% add_surface()
```
