<font size = "4"> My interest is in using data as a tool to answer research questions and test hypotheses. Previously, I investigated statistical and analytical tools at Appalachian State University. I graduated in May 2019 with a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics, a concentration in Physics, and a minor in Statistics. Through my time at App State, I developed a passion for programming and analyzing data. Currently, I am looking for opportunities that will enable me to grow and utilize my experience and skills with mathematics, statistics, and programming. </font>
