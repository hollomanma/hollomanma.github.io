This is my website that I have made for my Data Science 1 (STT 3530) course at Appalachain State University. This website includes my interests, contact information, resumes, and a few fun pictures so you can get a better feel for what I'm all about.

## Interests:
* Math, Physics, and computing
* hiking, snowboarding, and cooking
* music:
    * Flume (the all time best), ODESZA, Hermitude, Tame Impala, Red Hot Chili Peppers
    * [The almighty Flume performing live :)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oufPs0zPuyw)
