My interest is in using data as a tool to answer research questions and test hypotheses. Currently, I investigate statistical and analytical tools at Appalachian State University. I am an undergraduate student studying in Mathematics with a Physics concentration. Through my time at App State, I developed a passion for programming and analyzing data. As a senior, I am looking for opportunities that will enable me to grow and utilize my experience and skills with mathematics, statistics and programming.
